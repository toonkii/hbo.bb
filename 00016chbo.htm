Asbolus was a Centaur and seer who read omens in the flight of birds. When Heracles came to visit the Centaur Pholus, the latter opened a jug of wine 
which had been given as a gift to all the Centaurs. Asbolus saw Pholus do this and brought the others running for their share of the wine. The gathering 
became violent and a battle ensued in which Heracles slew a number of Centaurs, among whom Chiron and Pholus were accidental victims.</b></p></td>

Ixion was the son of Antion and Perimela, and a king in Thessaly. When he married Dia the daughter of Eioneus, he failed to pay her dowry. Consequently, 
his father-in-law kept Ixion's mares as security for the payment. Promising to pay, Ixion lured Eioneus to his kingdom, and then murdered his father-in-law 
by throwing him into a flaming pit. The murder of a kinsman was an especially horrendous act in Greek society, and no man or god would purify him of it. 
Taking pity on him, Zeus took Ixion to Mount Olympus for the ritual cleansing. While there, Ixion attempted to seduce Hera. She informed Zeus, who decided 
to test the king. Shaping the cloud nymph Nephele to look like Hera, Zeus placed her in Ixion's bed. Believing Nephele to be Hera, Ixion made love to her. 
For Ixion's betrayal, Zeus condemned him to eternal punishment in Hades, chained to a fiery wheel.<br><br>

From the union between Ixion and Nephele was born the deformed Centaurus. An outcast, Centaurus lived in the wild and eventually mated with the Magnesian 
mares. His offspring were the half man half horse race known as the Centaurs.</b></p></td>

Unlike the other Centaurs, Chiron was not a descendant of King Ixion of the Lapiths, but the son of Cronus and the sea nymph, Philyra. Whereas the other 
Centaurs were wild and brutish, Chiron was civilized, exceptionally wise and honorable. While the other Centaurs were mortal, Chiron, because of his birth, 
was immortal. He was taught by Apollo and Artemis, becoming a master of hunting, gymnastics, medicine, music, and prophesy. He in turn became a teacher, and 
among his pupils were the heroes Achilles, Heracles and Jason. During the battle between Heracles and the Centaurs, Chiron was grazed by one of the hero's 
poisened arrows. Although Chiron was immortal and so could not die from the wound, he voluntarily gave up his immortality to put an end to his suffering 
from the poison.</b></p></td>

God of wine, or more generally the god of inspiration; as well as drunkeness, and irrational or altered states, such as religious ecstasy. In contrast to 
the rational Apollo, he may be said to represent the irrational impulses in human nature. A shape-changer, he could take the form of an animal, but also 
appeared as human. He was often accompanied by revellers or animals. He was a patron of actors, and plays were regularly performed at the Athenian festivals 
held in his honor. His cult was widely popular. Dionysus was identified by the Romans as Bacchus.</b></p></td>

Nessus was a Centaur and a ferryman on the river Euenos. After carrying Deianeira, Heracles' wife, across the river, he attempted to force himself upon 
her. Heracles saw this from the other side of the river and shot a Hydra-poisoned arrow into Nessus's chest. In malice, as he lay dying, Nessus told 
Deianeira that his blood would ensure that Heracles would be true to her forever, and foolishly Deianeira believed him. Later, when she began to doubt 
Heracles' fidelity because of Iole (daughter of King Eurytus), Deianeira spread the centaur's blood on a shirt and gave it to her husband. While Heracles 
was at a gathering of warriors, Deianeira accidentally spilled a portion of Nessus' blood onto the floor. To her amazement, it began to fume in the light 
of the rising sun. Horrified by what would happen if Heracles wore the shirt dipped in blood, Deianeira sent a messenger to warn her husband not to put 
it on. But the messenger arrived too late, Heracles was dying slowly and painfully as the shirt burned his skin. After his death, Zeus made Heracles 
immortal by placing him among the stars in the night sky.</b></p></td>

myth, Sedna is portrayed as a beautiful maiden who rejects offers of marriage from the hunters of her village. One day when an unknown hunter appears, 
Sedna's father agrees to marry his daughter to the stranger in exchange for fish. Sedna is given a sleeping potion to drink and is taken away by the 
stranger to a large nest on a distant cliff. There the identity of her abducter is revealed to be a bird-spirit.  When Sedna awakes, she cries for help, 
and her father attempts to rescue her. Enraged, the bird-spirit conjures up a powerful storm. In desperation, Sedna's father throws her into the sea. As 
Sedna's clings to her father's kayak, her fingers freeze and fall off becoming seals, walruses and whales. Sedna sinks down to to the bottom of sea and 
becomes the goddess of the Underworld. Hunters pray to her that animals of the sea may be provided for their hunts.</b></p></td>
