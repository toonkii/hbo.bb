Born: April 28, 1900, in Franeker, Netherlands<br>
Died: November 5, 1992, in Leiden, Netherlands</h2>

After graduating from Groningen University, Jan Hendrik Oort was appointed astronomer to Leiden Observatory in 1924. The following year, 
Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad theorized that the Milky Way rotates in its own plane around the centre of the galaxy. In 1927, Oort was 
able to confirm this hypothesis through his own observations of star velocities in the galaxy. In his subsequent work, he focused his efforts 
on testing and strengthening the Lindblad-Oort theory.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
In 1935, Oort became a professor of Leiden University. In the same year, using radio astronomy, he was able to determine that the Sun is 30,000 
lightyears from the Milky Way's centre and takes 225 million years to make a complete orbit around it.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
Oort was promoted to director of Leiden Observatory in 1945, and held that post until 1970.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
In 1950, Oort advanced the theory that comets originate from a vast cloud made up of small bodies composed of rock and ice, orbiting the Sun at a 
distance of about one lightyear. He postulated that when the orbits of these bodies are disturbed, for example by the influence of approaching stars, 
they are sometimes nudged into trajectories that take them close to the Sun. Over time, astronomers have come to accept the existence of this region 
and have named it the Oort Cloud in his honour.</p>

The discovery of interstellar hydrodrogen's 21cm emission line</font><font face="Arial" font color="#ffa272" size="4"><b>*</b></font> in 1951 
(by American physicists Harold Ewen and Edward Purcell), was a boon for astronomers. Using this new knowledge as a tool, Oort was able to map 
the Milky Way's spiral structure in 1952.</p>

Among his other achievements, Oort served as general-secretary of the International Astronomical Union from 1935 to 1948, and as president of the 
organization from 1958 to 1961.</p>

<p id="p04" align="left"><font face="Arial" font color="#ffa272" size="2"><b>*</b></font>The hydrogen 21cm emission line refers to the electromagnetic 
radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation is at the precise 
frequency of 1402.4 MHz, which is equivalent to 21.1 cm in free space. This wave length, or frequency, falls within the microwave radio region of the 
electrmagnetic spectrum, and it is used frequently in radio astronomy, since those radio waves can penetrate the large 
clouds of interstellar dust which are opaque to visible light.</p>
