<h1>Dr. Harry Bayley</h1>

<p id="p01" align="left">
“Dr. Bayley (1908-1958) was perhaps the most brilliant Barbadian physician of his own or any previous generation. He carried 
 out research on many topics and earned an MD (Cambridge) for his individual work on the disease leptospirosis in the 1940s, 
 demonstrating the real cause of what had been known for generations as ‘Barbados jaundice’.  He built the first modern hospital 
 and medical laboratory in Barbados (the Diagnostic Clinic) and introduced many techniques of modern laboratory and clinical 
 medicine to Barbados.”</p>

<h1>Barbados Astronomical Society</h1>

<p id="p01" align="left">
 The Barbados Astronomical Society is an incorporated, non-profit organization of amateur astronomers, and was founded on June 12, 
 1956, by Dr. Harry Bayley and Mr. Eustace Thomas. When Dr. Bayley died in  1958, the membership voted to erect an observatory in 
 his memory.  An acre of land at Clapham, St. Michael, was donated for the site  of the building which was designed by the late 
 Barbara Hill. Following a five-year campaign of fund-raising by members and donations from a generous public, the observatory was 
 constructed and finally dedicated in January 1963.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">The Society's objectives are:</font></p>

<p align="left">
<ul><b>
<li>To promote, foster and develop the knowledge of astronomy to residents of, and visitors to, Barbados.</li>
<li>To instruct its members in the technical use and care of its instruments.</li>
<li>To inform its members of anticipated astronomical phenomena.</li>
</b></ul>
