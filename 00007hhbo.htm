Terence Dickinson is a prolific science writer specializing in astronomy. More than one million copies of his 15 books are in print in five languages. His 
ability to simplify astronomical concepts and explain the universe in easily understood terms has earned him a vast readership not only in North America, 
but internationally. Through his books and magazine articles, and as an invited speaker at more than 100 professional societies, universities, colleges, and 
astronomy conventions throughout North America, hundreds of thousands of would-be stargazers and naturalists have found a new appreciation for the wonders 
of the universe.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
Mr. Dickinson is also editor of <i>SkyNews</i>, Canada's national astronomy magazine, and a regular astronomy commentator on radio and television. As an 
accomplished astrophotographer, his photographs have appeared in publications as wide-ranging as <i>Australian Geographic</i> and <i>Reader's Digest</i> 
and, in 2000, the US Postal Service featured one of his photographs of the moon on a stamp. The International Astronomical Union officially designated 
asteroid 5272 Dickinson in honor of his contributions to astronomy. He is the recipient of more than a dozen national and international science-writing 
awards, including the New York Academy of Science Book of the Year Award. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in recognition of his 
achievements in popularizing science.</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
In March 2006, at the invitation of the Barbados Astronomical Society, Mr. Dickinson visited Barbados and delivered the first Harry Bayley Memorial 
Lecture which was well-received by a large and appreciative audience. (See <a href="00006bhbo.htm">Archives</a>.)</p>

<p id="p01" align="left">
Mr. Dickinson and his wife Susan live under dark night skies in rural eastern Ontario. He designed his own fully-equipped observatory which is just steps 
outside the house.</p>
