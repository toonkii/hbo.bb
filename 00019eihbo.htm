<h2>Frank M. Lewecke</h2>

<p id="p05"><b>
Born: 1966, in Gutersloh, Germany</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
Frank Lewecke is a painter, designer and illustrator. In 1995, he became a freelance artist, and in 1996 a member 
of the International Association of Astronomical Artists. He thinks of his paintings as snapshots of "distant worlds 
in space and time."</b></p>

<h2>Ed Hengeveld</h2>

<p id="p05"><b>
Born: 1956, in the Netherlands</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
Ed Hengeveld is a spaceflight historian who lives with his wife and son in the Netherlands, where he works for 
Dutch television news. He has written numerous articles for Spaceflight and Quest, as well as for various Dutch 
newspapers and magazines.</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
In the artist's own words: "This is the largest painting (30" x 16") I ever made... The collector who commissioned 
me wanted a painting of Apollo 16 astronauts (John) Young and (Charles) Duke examining the large rock they found 
during EVA-2, called 'House Rock'. There are no good photos of that rock and I had to use the television tapes to 
see what it looked like. I wanted to show the huge size of the rock, which dwarfed the astronauts working beside it."</b></p>

<p id="p02"><b>Impact On Mars - by William Hartmann</b></p>
<h2>William Kenneth Hartmann</h2>

<p id="p05"><b>
Born: June 6, 1939, in Pennsylvania, USA</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
Astronomer, author, artist, and co-founder of the Planetary Science Institute, William Hartmann is also an expert in the 
study of small celestial bodies (comets and asteroids), and the formation of meteoric impacts on solid bodies.  For his 
doctoral thesis, he argued that Earth's tilt and the Moon's genesis was the result of a great impact. Although criticized 
at first, Hartmann's theory is now generally accepted.</b></p>

Born: 1951, in Easton, Pennsylvania, USA</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
On January 14, 2005, the space probe Huygens parachuted through the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, and became the 
first craft to make a landing in the Outer Solar System. This is the artist's rendering of that historic event.</b></p>

In the artist's own words: "Space and astronomical art strives to illustrate the Universe... What is important to notice 
is that space and astronomical art is based on the knowledge we have of the Universe.</b></p> 

<p id="p05"><b>
I see space and astronomical art as a complement to real astronomical imagery. By basing the artwork on knowledge in astrophysics, 
chemistry and other sciences, the artist can overcome technological and physical barriers and create a probable view of an environment 
that is otherwise inaccessible to us."</b></p>

<p id="p02"><b>The Eagle is Headed Home - by Alan Bean</b></p>
<h2>Alan LaVern Bean</h2>

<p id="p05"><b>
Born: March 15, 1932, Wheeler, Texas, USA</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
In this painting former Apollo astronaut, Alan Bean, captures the moment when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (the first men 
on the Moon) blast off from Tranquility Base on their way back to the Command Module, the first leg of their journey back 
to Earth.</b></p>

<p id="p05"><b>
Former Captain Bean was himself a member of NASA's Apollo 12 Mission, and the fourth man to walk on the Moon. In his own 
words: "I am fortunate enough to have seen sights no other artist ever has. I want my paintings to communicate an emotional 
experience in ways that photography cannot."</b></p>
