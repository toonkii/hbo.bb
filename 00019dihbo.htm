<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft is a collaborative project undertaken by NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space 
Agency. It was launched as a composite craft, comprising the Saturn orbiter, Cassini, and the Titan probe/lander, Huygens. After 
a 7 year trip, the spacecraft arrived safely at Saturn at the beginning of July 2004. On December 25, 2004, Huygens detached itself 
from Cassini and travelled to Saturn's largest moon, Titan. It arrived there on January 14, 2005, descended through Titan's atmosphere 
and successfully landed on the moon's surface. It is the first landing of a spacecraft in the Outer Solar System.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
In the decade it has spent orbiting Saturn, the Cassini spacecraft has relayed invaluable information about the planet and its 
satellites. Among its discoveries are geysers in the southern hemisphere of Enceladus, the plumes of which eject water, carbon 
dioxide and other compounds into space. Cassini's mission at Saturn is ongoing, and the spacecraft is expected to be operational 
until at least 2017.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Cassini is named after the French/Italian astronomer, Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625-1712), who observed four of Saturn's moons and 
discovered the Cassini Division in the planet's rings.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Huygens is named after the Dutch astronomer, <a href="00007ihbo.htm">Christiaan Huygens</a> (1629-1695), who discovered Saturn's moon 
Titan in 1655 and was the first to postulate that Saturn's rings were composed of solid material.</b></p>

The European Union’s Giotto spacecraft (named after the Italian medieval painter <a href="00019eiihbo.htm"><b>Giotto di Bondone</b></a>) 
was one of six missions specifically launched to study Comet Halley during its passage through the Solar System in 1986. The other spacecraft 
were Suisei and Sakigake from Japan; Vega 1 and 2 from the Soviet Union; and Ice from the United States. However, it was Giotto which made the 
closest approach to the comet (596km), enabling it to capture images of the comet’s nucleus for the first time ever. Although Giotto was slightly 
damaged by dust particles from Comet Halley, its mission was extended to include a fly-by of Comet Grigg-Skjellerup. This new mission was successfully 
achieved on July 10, 1992, with Giotto coming within 200km of the comet. Giotto was deactivated on July 23, 1992.</b></p>

<font face="Arial" font color="#ffa272" size="2"><b>MISSION: </b></font>
<font face="Arial" font color="#383838" size="2"><b>The Soviet Union's Luna missions began in 1959, and ended in 1976. The missions were designed to 
collect information about the Moon and its environment, not only for scientific purposes, but also for planning future exploration of the satellite. The 
ultimate objective was to send manned missions to the Moon, but that goal was not achieved.</b></font>
</p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
On February 3, 1966, the USSR’s Luna 9 became the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon, or any other planetary body other than Earth, 
and to transmit photographic data to Earth from the surface of another planet.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Luna 9 was launched into space by a Molniya-M type rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (now Kazakhstan).</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Weighing 218lbs (or 99kg), Luna 9 used a landing bag to cushion itself against the impact of its landing speed of 14mph (or 22kph).  Its descent to 
the lunar surface was the Soviet Union’s twelfth attempt to land a craft on the Moon. Functioning perfectly, the spacecraft bounced several times before 
finally coming to rest in the Oceanus Procellarum (‘Ocean of Storms’), west of craters Reiner and Marius.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Five minutes after Luna 9’s landing, the four ‘petals’ covering the top half of the craft opened exposing spring-loaded antennae and an array of 
surveying equipment. However, it was several hours later (only after the Sun had climbed to 7° elevation), that Luna 9 was able to begin transmitting 
photographic data to Earth.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
In all Luna 9 made 7 radio transmissions, totaling 8 hours and five minutes, as well as three series of TV relays.  From the data received, nine images 
were obtained, including five panoramic images of the lunar surface.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Apart from Luna 9’s successful transmission of data, its landing on the Moon dispelled the notion that spacecraft sent to the lunar surface would sink 
into a thick layer of dust, paving the way for manned missions to the Moon.</b></p>

India's Mars Orbiter Mission, known informally as Mangalyaan ('Mars craft' in Hindi), is that country's first spacecraft sent to the Red Planet. India 
is now one of the only four nations to have sent scientific probes to Mars, the other three being the USA, Russia, and the European Union. Mangalyaan's 
mission will last 6 to 10 months. Its primary scientific objective is to study Mars' surface features. However, the spacecraft is equipped with a methane 
sensor which will be used to detect the amount of methane present in the Martian atmosphere. The presence of methane is a key indicator of life, and 
scientists wish to determine whether the origin of methane on Mars is ambiental, or due to past, or present, biological sources.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
In terms of technology, Mangalyaan's mission to Mars will serve as a test and demonstration of India's capability for future interplanetary scientific 
exploration.</b></p>

<p id="p05" align="left"><b>
Messenger was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury since Mariner 10 in 1975. From April 4, 2011, the probe relayed data to Earth. It completely 
mapped the planet, taking some 100,000 images. Messenger also elucidated the nature of the planet's magnetic field, and discovered water ice at 
Mercury's north pole, confirming observations made on Earth. On April 30, 2015, Messenger impacted the planet's surface after the spacecraft
