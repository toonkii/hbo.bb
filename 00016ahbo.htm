Apep was represented as a giant snake, and his titles included <i>Snake of the Nile</i> and <i>Enemy of Ra</i>, among others.</b></p></td>

blanketed the world in cloud. Suspicious, Here dispersed the clouds, and Zeus was forced to hide Io by transforming her into a beautiful white cow. 
Suspecting that the cow was really Zeus' lover, Here asked for it as a gift, a request that Zeus could not refuse. To thwart Zeus, Here had Io watched 
and guarded by the hundred-eyed watchman, Argus Panoptes. However, Hermes, disguised as a shepherd, lulled Argus Panoptes into a deep sleep 
and slew him. Io was set free, but was forced by Here to wander the world for many years. The Ionian Sea and the Bosphorus (meaning 'ford of the 
cow') are named after her. Eventually Io reached the Nile in Egypt and was transformed into human form again.  She bore Zeus a son, Epaphus, 
forefather of the great hero Heracles.</b></p></td>

were true. She warned her fellow citizens about the danger of accepting the Trojan Horse, but her warnings were unheeded. During the sack of Troy by 
the Greeks, she sought refuge in the Temple of Athene, but was raped, and ended up being taken by King Agamemnon to Greece.  There, both were 
murdered by Agamemnon's wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus.</b></p></td>

disciplined, strategic warfare.  The Parthenon built on the Acropolis of Athens is dedicated to her.  The spear, distaff, aegis (goatskin 
shield), serpent (symbol of perpetual renovation), owl, and the olive tree were sacred to her.  Her Roman counterpart was Minerva.</b></p></td>
