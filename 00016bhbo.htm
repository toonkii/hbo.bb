Charon was the ferryman of Hades, whose task was to transport the souls of the recently deceased across the rivers Styx and Acheron which divided 
the Underworld.  He is depicted as a grey-haired, bearded and unkempt old man. In ancient burial rituals, coins were placed on or in the mouth of 
the deceased to pay Charon for his services. The souls who were unable to pay Charon had to roam the banks of the rivers for a hundred years as 
punishment.</b></p></td>

A minor god in the Greek pantheon, Erebus was the personification of primordial darkness, the consort of Nyx (night). He was said to be the father 
of Aether (the upper atmosphere) and Hemera (day). Some myths also say that he was Charon's father. Over time, Erebus became synonymous with an 
upper region of the Underworld, sometimes even referring to Hades, god of the Underworld. On Earth, Mount Erebus is the second highest volcano in 
Antartica, and the southernmost active volcano in the world. On Mars, a crater is named after this god.</b></p></td>

Hydra was a nine-headed serpent living in a swamp near the ancient town of Lerna in Argolis, Greece. (In different verions of the myth, the number 
of its heads varies from five to a hundred.) Hydra's principal head could not be harmed by any weapon, and if any of the other heads was severed, 
another one would grow in its place. The monster terrorized the town by preying on both cattle and people. In the second of his twelve labours, 
Hercules was sent to slay the serpent. To defeat Hydra, Hercules had to adopt a strategy: as one by one he chopped off its secondary heads, his 
nephew Iolaus would cauterize each stump with a burning brand, and so prevented new heads from regenerating. As the one remaining head could not 
be harmed by any weapon, Hercules severed it with his bare hands, then crushed it with a blow from his club.</b></p></td>

her children to live with the immortals, and Styx became the goddess in whose name solemn oaths were made. Styx was also one of the principal rivers of 
the Underworld which the souls of the deceased had to cross in order to enter Hades. It separated the world of the living from the world of the dead.

Zeus threw Typhon into Tartarus, the Underworld's deepest pit, and covered him with Mount Etna to prevent his escape.</b></p></td>
